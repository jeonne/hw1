I was experiencing with some elements that we went over the class on Monday. I have changed colors and sizes of some elements 
as well as movements. 

- createCanvas(450, 650); Changed the canvas size from (600, 400) 
- radius = 25; Changed radius size from 50 to 25
- background(200, 237, 119); Changed the color of background from background(255)(white) to neon green
- fill(255, 21, 111, 205); Fill colors for the circle from fill(255, 200, 200, 200)
- fill(255, 199, 69); Fill else color for the cirle from fill(255, 220, 200, 200)
- x += random(-9, 9);
  y += random(-8, 8); from  x += random(-1, 1);  y += random(-1, 1); changed the movement levels.
